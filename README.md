# Mini Toy Computer

The project is based on [RASP-Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_stored-program_machine).
I use this to practice data structures and algorithms on very low-level.
This is also a project to learn more about computers.

The machine can already process the basic instructions described in Wikipedia.
The compiler is currently missing so, you have to use binary numbers and not comment your code.

## Use Instruction
Write your code in any text-editor and call the main program with a file as an argument
```python3 main.py <your_program>```.
